# PlatformerPizzaGame

A platformer game developed over an existing base game.  
Most of the features are newly added and the almost all of the existing structure has been modified.  

Developed in C and C++ using the SDL (SDL2) library for input/output and user interactions.  
Visiual Studio and its tools have been utilised during the development and the testing processes.  

Python is used for developing an external program to create and design the levels in the game.
